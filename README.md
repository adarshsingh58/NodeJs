We have 
- Model folder: DB connections
- View folder: UI Components like html/ejs files
- controller: Actual Logic for routes
- routes: routers defined here
- public: all static file available to cached on browser
- middleware: all middleware logic
- service: we can have a service folder to move some core logic from controller to service.

Ideas for application:
- BookMyShow
- Password Manager
- Note taking App
- Price tracker
- Credit card local payment system
